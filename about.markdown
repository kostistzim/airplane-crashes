We’re Josefine, Sara, and Kostis—three students of DTU united by a shared interest for data and storytelling.

This website presents our analysis of historical aircraft accidents, exploring trends in safety over the decades. We've used data visualization to tell the story of how aviation has evolved.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For those interested in the technical details of our data processing, the specific analytical steps taken, the libraries used, and the code behind our visualizations, we've prepared a comprehensive explainer Jupyter Notebook. This notebook provides a deeper dive into our methodology and the "behind-the-scenes" work.
